generic in java is besically Type safe the programm

* type safe means the data type is already define 
if while wirting code if we use diffferent data type for the method 
we will get error at the time of compilation 

we can type safe a funtion by using <DataType> 

eg
ArrayList<String> arr = new ArrayList();  // this is Type safe
    -here we only add Strimg data to arr
    arr.add("hi")';

ArrayList arr = new ArrayList(); 
/* this is not type safe we add diffferent data in this 

# Similarly we can create our own generic funtions;

public class master<Integer>   // now this class is only taking int 
{

}

** in generic <DataType> is Wrapper class
